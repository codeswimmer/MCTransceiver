It has been developed using Xcode 5 & tested against iOS 7.x.\r\n\r\n##### Documentation\r\nThe Xcode project includes a `Documentation` target which can be used to generate documentation for the API. It requires the use of [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/). Once you've built the documentation it will be available through Xcode's Documentation window.\r\n\r\nThe latest [HTML documentation](https://github.com/KeithErmel/MCTransceiver/docs/index.html) is also available.\r\n\r\n##### Examples\r\nThe <code>[Examples](https://github.com/KeithErmel/MCTransceiver/tree/master/Examples)</code> folder includes a the [MCTransceiverExample](https://github.com/KeithErmel/MCTransceiver/tree/master/Examples/MCTransceiverExample) project that demonstrates communication between two iOS devices: one acting as the advertiser <code>(host)</code> the other as the browser <code>(join)</code>.\r\n\r\n###### Advertising, Browsing and Sending Data\r\n* While this API is presented through a single interface -- [MCTransceiver](https://github.com/KeithErmel/MCTransceiver/blob/master/MCTransceiver/MCTransceiver/MCTransceiver.h) -- the tasks of advertising and browsing are provided separately, through the <code>startAdvertising:</code> and <code>startBrowsing:</code> methods.\r\n\r\n* Currently the only way to send data from one device to another is through the <code>sendUnreliableData:toPeers:completion</code> method. From the documentation, sending data unreliably means:\r\n> Messages to peers should be sent immediately without socket-level queueing. If a message cannot be sent immediately, it should be dropped. The order of messages is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\n* Future additions to this API will provide the ability to:\r\n    * Send reliable data (guaranteed, in-order delivery, retransmitted as needed)\r\n    * Send a resource based on URL to a peer\r\n    * Stream data to a peer\r\n    \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
